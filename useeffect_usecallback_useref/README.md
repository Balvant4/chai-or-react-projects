# React + Vite

# Password Generator Application

This is a simple password generator application built using React. The application allows users to generate a random password with customizable length and options to include numbers and special characters. Below are the steps and explanations for the main functionalities of the code.

# Importing Necessary Hooks and Components

useEffect: To perform side effects in function components.
useCallback: To memoize functions and prevent unnecessary re-renders.
useState: To manage local state in functional components.
useRef: To access DOM elements directly.

# Initializing State and References

length: Stores the length of the password (default is 8).
password: Stores the generated password.
characterAllowed: Boolean state to determine if special characters are allowed in the password.
numberAllowed: Boolean state to determine if numbers are allowed in the password.
passwordRef: Reference to the password input field to facilitate copying the password to the clipboard.
Password Generator Function

# The passwordGenerator function generates a random password based on the selected criteria:

# String Initialization: Initializes a string with alphabetic characters.

Include Numbers: Adds numeric characters if numberAllowed is true.
Include Special Characters: Adds special characters if characterAllowed is true.
Generate Password: Iterates over the length and randomly picks characters from the initialized string to create a password.

# Copy Password Function

The copypassword function copies the generated password to the clipboard using the navigator.clipboard.writeText API.

# useEffect Hook

The useEffect hook is used to call the passwordGenerator function whenever the dependencies (length, characterAllowed, numberAllowed) change, ensuring the password is updated accordingly.

# JSX Structure

Header: Displays the title of the application.
Password Display and Copy Button: Shows the generated password and provides a button to copy it.
Controls:
Length Slider: Allows the user to adjust the length of the password.
Number Checkbox: Toggles the inclusion of numeric characters.
Character Checkbox: Toggles the inclusion of special characters.
